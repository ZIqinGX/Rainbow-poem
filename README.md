# Rainbow-poem

This is a practice of using Github from The cding Train
And now I am trying to clone the github repository and make some change.
After that, I will push these change back to my github.

Today is Tuesday. May 2nd.
I finished my homework this afternoon and want to learn sth about git hub.
Weather is good.

The key words for today are machine learning, deep learning and baking.:)

I have followed the tutorial and now I am going to do that again.
